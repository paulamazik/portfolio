    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> We started the theme Basic Content with a group work. Our given task was to create a website about biking in Copenhagen. Our TEAM10 after a few hours of discussing, gathering ideas, started working on the XD Prototype. 
     
     <br>
     <br>
     We had a few ideas that we wanted to use on our website such as creating the rental options, bike routes, adding a few biking rules. We created 3 bike routes- one for a beginner, one for an intermediate and one for a pro, depending on which level is the biker on. 
     
     <br>
     <br>
        During this project not only we were improving our XD and Illustrator skills, but also focusing on improving our usage of the design principles. It was also an opportunity to learn how to work in a team which involves lots of respect, hearing people out and keeping in mind that not only your ideas might be good.</p>
