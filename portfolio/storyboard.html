        <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> While being in the same group formations, after the treatment, we started working on out storyboard for the video.

        <br>
        It simply showes us how we wanted each shoot to look like and also it describes the location, sound, duration, the size of a shoot,the angle, transition. 
        
         <br>
         <br>
         It was the first time creating a storyboard. We had a few attemps since we made it way too general at the beginning. It involved lots of changes, understanding our mistakes. However it was a really useful tool while filming the video, and we used the knowledge a few more times later during the 1st semester. </p>
