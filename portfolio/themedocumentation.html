    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> Then the time to gather all the things we have done during the theme Basic UX camr. In this PDF file you are able to see my journey- the initial brief, the research, testing, design sprint, web prototype, design sprint: native app. The PDF file consists of explaination about everything I have done- you can see images of the process, all the documents, all the tests.

          It was another opportunity for us to work on the way we document things. It is a long and definitely not an easy thing to remember everything you have done and talk about it in a way that people would understand. Hoewever, I found this project appealing and realized that it is actually something that I like doing. 
          Enjoy reading all the pages (49) since I sometimes don't know how to stop talking and writing, so there's no way back. :)

          Also if you have read all of the things (that don't really make sense and might be a little bit messy, just like me) on my website, congrats! I'm really proud of you and wishing you a good day (or night)! :)
