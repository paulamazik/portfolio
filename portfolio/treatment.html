        <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> We came back to the same group formations as while creating the XD Prototype. This time we had to write a treatment for the video for our website. <br>
        <br>
        We learned how to write treatments for the first time. It is a really useful knowledge which makes it easier to plan the filming. 

        <br>
        <br>
        Our idea was to combine 3 stories at once, the story of a beginner, intermediate, pro which was related to our bike routes idea for the website. We chose when and where we would shoot each scene. Even though we changed it a little later while filming, it made it easier to plan everything out and understand what we really want to show the audience.</p>
