    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> This assignment was divided into three parts: part one (creating a style tile, story, genre message), part two (storyboard, worksheet), part three (spritesheet animation).  All of them were meant to help us create our final product which was our own animation. 
         <br>
         <br>
         We had to think what we want to show, how we want to show it and how we want to make it. We had to think about things such as  the genre, mood, characters, their characteristics, their background, the narrative curve. 
          <br>
          <br> 
          It was a long process, but really important one as it made us realise that there is much more to it than just making an animation. It involves lots of thinking about things that aren't that obvious such as who the character is, their goals, personality.

          My story was about a witch and a devil in a modern world. It was a metaphor of how the world works nowadays, it was about independency and strong women who are being whoever they want to be.

           It was a chance for me to gain skills in the design field, work with Illustrator and try documenting things again. It was also an exercise when it comes to coding and especially CSS and Javascript. It was the first time I did something like this in my life and even though it doesn't look the way I wanted it to look, I worked hard on it and it was definitely a good start when it comes to my journey with animation.
