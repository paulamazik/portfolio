    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> This time our tast given was to find a solution for the client (in that case- KEA). The first step was to create the XD prototype based on the initial user brief, user research we have made during the previous week. The process was devided into 5 days, each day we had a different area of focus.
          <br>
          On day 1 we started mapping the problem, keeping in mind the target audience and the long-term goal which in our case was to create a place for KEA students to show their work and give them the opportunity to collab with companies, also being introduced to the user flow again. We also did some testing. On day 2 we started sketching, exchanging ideas, we also tried the crazy 8s medthod for the first time.  We made the storyboard and the paper prototypes. Day 3 we spent deciding, choosing solutions. Then it came to day 4 which was a day for creating the actual XD prototype that we tested on day 5. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We learned what the Design Sprint actually is and how it works. It is an important knowledge that we can use in the future while working with the clients. The devided process made us focus more on each part. We had the opportunity to work in groups again, work on our XD skills as well as on storyboarding, sketching, mapping, testing.
