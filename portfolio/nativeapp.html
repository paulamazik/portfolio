     <div class="description">
    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> Our goal was to create a native app which would be the learning management system of our dreams. We went through the design sprint process once again- we mapped, sketched, did the crazy 8s, created paper prototypes, decided, created the XD prototype and then tested our product. 
          
          <br>
          <br>
           While creating our app we focused on improving the communication between students and other students as well as the staff. We created our own messenger with options to send attachments, create group conversations. We created an option to see student's profile and also kept in mind the "change the language" option to make life easier for all the international students. 
           
           <br>
        <br>
          We worked on the prototype together, gathering ideas, discussing. It was again an opportunity for us to work in teams and learn how to work with other people who might not be the same as you. It was also a way for us to improve our XD skills and create something based on all the material we have gathered before.
