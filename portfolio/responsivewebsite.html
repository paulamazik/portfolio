    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> In the theme Basic Web we learned how to code websites and make them responsive. It all started with paper prototyping, creating an XD prototype as well as a mobile version and then the desktop version. I also tried user testing, using Photoshop and Illustrator for the first time while creating images and my logo for the website. It was a long process of how to plan, test, design and code websites. I have never coded before and it was my first meeting with HTML and CSS, and even though I struggled a lot, I still tried to make it all work. We all learn by making mistakes, and it definitely was my approach.
      
       <br>
       <br> I learned how to add images, text, links and work with layouts, burger menu, styling the content. On this website you can find informations about my given style which was punk, the moodboard, the typography, image assets and everything that was revelant to the website. You can also find some interesting texts and images about punk and especially about fashion at that time since it is what I want to be involved with after my studies.

       Even though it all doesn't look the way I'd want it to look, I tried my best and I'm proud of that. Now I'd do it all completly different, but we all need to start somewhere.  </p>
