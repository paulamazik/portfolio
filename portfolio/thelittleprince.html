    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> This project started with a collaboration agreement where all the group members decided on how the teamwork should look like. Then we decided that we want to work with the story called The Little Prine, keeping in mind that our given style is surrealism. We started by creating a personas collage, storyboard and did 2 user tests on our classmates to see if it all makes sense. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We devided the work into 3 different fields of interest: coding, designing, UX. We worked in pairs on the area we chose, but also helping each other and discussing all the ideas and things we have done. We did the backgrounds, characters, voice recordings.
          <br>
          <br>
          It was again an opportunity to work in groups with people we have never worked before which means that we had to be flexible, try to hear each other out and understand our personal visions. 
          For me it was a chance to work with the Illustrator and the character worksheet again, but also learning something new about coding and UX from others.
