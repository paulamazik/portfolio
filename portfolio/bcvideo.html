    <p class="description" style="font-size:2.5vw;"> Our goal was to create a video that would tell a story without words. 
      <br> 
      <br> 
      It was again a group project, so another opportunity to work with other people. The story we wanted to tell was a story of a student and their daily struggles. The student (me in this case as I was the actress) wakes up, gets ready, leaves the apartment, but while entering the elevator she starts dreaming of being in bed and falling asleep, she decides to leave the elevator and go back to the apartment. She jumps on the bed and suddenly she's happy again. 
      <br>

      We had a lot of fun while creating this video. During the lectures we learned about filming, editing, film language, dramaturgical elements, editing sound in Adobe Audition and because of this project we had a chance to use our knowledge in practice. We also had a chance to work with Adobe Premiere Pro for the first time in my case.

     Even though we got compliments about the bloopers which in this case was me hitting my head on the drawer while falling off my mattress, I'd like to say that I take acting seriously, the sound is real, everything is real, I almost died while filming it, but hey, the show must go on.  </p>
